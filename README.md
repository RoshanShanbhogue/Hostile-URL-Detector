# Hostile-URL-Detector (HUD)

* This is a multi-staged URL analysis tool to provide useful insights about an input URL.
* In this project we refer anything harmful whether financial, social or mental as hostile. We have proposed a methodology to detect or classify an input URL into one of the attack types
  and provide the user with more insight about the URL they are to visit. Here, we have made
  large set of labelled links (1,89,780 URLs- which is a combination of URLs taken from various
  sources and contains the types â€“ malware, malicious, adult, phishing, defacement and spam)
  on which we perform lexical feature extraction to gain more information about the link (to
  extract literary features) and various novel features which we have proposed are also extracted.
